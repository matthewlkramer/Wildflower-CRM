# `payment_applications.link_role` — counted vs corroborating

`payment_applications` (PA) is the unified unit↔gift ledger. Phase 5 folded the
old FK-less `gift_evidence_links` (gel) table INTO it as `link_role='corroborating'`
rows (design doc §5 Decision 2). So PA now holds two kinds of row:

- `counted` — the money trail. `amount_applied` is NOT NULL and > 0. Included in
  every SUM / tie / settled derivation.
- `corroborating` — an audit annotation (a gift↔evidence link that does NOT book
  money). `amount_applied` is NULL. Must NEVER enter a money total.

## The rule

**Every read of `payment_applications` that feeds a money total, a "has a payment
landed?" check, or a tie/settled derivation MUST filter `link_role = 'counted'`.**
The role-scoped partial uniques and the role-aware `amount_applied` CHECK enforce
write shape, but reads are plain SQL — nothing stops a query from summing/【EXISTS】-ing
across both roles.

**Why:** A code review caught a real leak — `giftPaymentSummary.ts`
(`settledGrossForGift`, `hasLinkedPaymentForGift`) filtered only
`evidence_source='quickbooks'`, not `link_role='counted'`. A gift whose ONLY PA
row was corroborating (exactly what the corrections `/apply` flow and the 0090
backfill produce) flipped `hasLinkedPayment` TRUE, changing `derivedSettledAmount`
from NULL ("nothing landed yet") to '0' ("settled $0") — the precise distinction
that read model exists to preserve. No counted SUM moved a dollar (corroborating
amount is NULL), but it silently corrupted a derived money surface the moment the
dual-write/backfill ran.

**How to apply:** When adding or reviewing any PA reader, grep for
`payment_applications` and confirm each one carries `link_role = 'counted'` (the
helpers in `artifacts/api-server/src/lib/paymentApplications.ts` already do; the
raw subqueries in `giftPaymentSummary.ts` now do too). The regression guard is the
"corroborating links stay out of the settled read model" test in
`financialCorrections.integration.test.ts` (corroborating-only gift ⇒
`derivedSettledAmount` NULL).

## Related

The corroborating rows have their own per-anchor partial uniques
(`..._corroborating_uq`, partial on `link_role='corroborating'`), DISJOINT from the
counted book-once uniques, so a counted and a corroborating row for the same
(anchor, gift) coexist.

## Read-flip is DONE — gel is frozen; parity is no longer a gate

The Phase-5 read-flip has shipped: `gift_evidence_links` (gel) is now WRITE-FROZEN.
The corroborating ledger is the SOLE home for evidence↔gift links. No api-server
source reads or writes gel anymore — corrections `/apply` writes only the
corroborating PA row, and giftCombine re-homes only corroborating PA rows (keyed on
the anchor `qb:{paymentId}` / `st:{stripeChargeId}`, deleting the loser's row when
the survivor already corroborates that anchor to dodge 23505). The only remaining
references are historical comments + the design doc + migrations 0063/0090/0091.

## gel is DROPPED (Phase 5 S7 complete)

The physical `DROP TABLE gift_evidence_links` shipped as the reviewed, human-applied
`lib/db/migrations/0091_drop_gift_evidence_links.sql` (idempotent `IF EXISTS`, no
CASCADE — gel had only outgoing FKs, so RESTRICT-on-surprise is the safe default;
applied via `psql -1`). The Drizzle schema file, its barrel export, and the obsolete
`parity-gift-evidence-links.ts` script + its package.json entry are all gone; the
test's gel references (the `gelCount()` regression guard, schema field, dbMod
assignment, afterAll cleanup) were removed. The corroborating PA ledger is now the
ONLY home for evidence↔gift links — there is no `parity:gift-evidence-links` gate.

**Prod ordering (durable lesson):** once you DROP a table in DEV, dev is AHEAD of
prod, so ANY Publish before the human applies the DROP SQL on prod makes the drizzle
Publish diff propose the destructive DROP against prod (Publish diffs dev↔prod, not
code↔prod). Apply the reviewed DROP SQL to prod FIRST, THEN Publish. Same drop either
way, but SQL-first keeps the reviewed-SQL invariant and dodges this repo's distrusted
/ interactively-aborting Publish drop-diffs.
